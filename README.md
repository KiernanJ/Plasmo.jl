# Plasmo.jl
Plasmo.jl (Platform for Scalable Modeling and Optimization) is a graph-based algebraic modeling framework.  It builds upon
JuMP and adopts a modular style to model optimization problems which facilitates creating distributed and hierarchical structures.
The defining notion of the package is that it uses graph-based concepts to both construct and partition optimization problems which
provides a natural interface to implement distributed optimization algorithms.

## Overview
The core object in Plasmo.jl is the `ModelGraph` wherein a user can add `ModelNode`(s) which represent individual optimization problems. `ModelNode`(s) can be linked to each-other
using linkconstraints, which induces the underlying distributed graph structure.  A modelgraph can also be embedded in another modelgraph to induce hierarchical structures.
Such distributed and hierarchical structures provide a natural framework to harness distributed optimization solvers such as [PIPS-NLP](https://github.com/Argonne-National-Laboratory/PIPS/tree/master/PIPS-NLP).

## Documentation
Documentation is available through [GitHub Pages](https://jalving.github.io/Plasmo.jl/dev).
Additional examples can be found in the [examples](https://github.com/jalving/Plasmo.jl/tree/master/examples/ModelGraph) folder.

## Installation

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("Plasmo.jl")
```

## Simple Example

```julia
using Plasmo
using Ipopt

graph = ModelGraph()

#Add nodes to a ModelGraph
@node(graph,n1)
@node(graph,n2)

#Add variables, constraints, and objective functions to nodes
@variable(n1,0 <= x <= 2)
@variable(n1,0 <= y <= 3)
@constraint(n1,x+y <= 4)
@objective(n1,Min,x)

@variable(n2,x)
@NLnodeconstraint(n2,exp(x) >= 2)

#Add a linkconstraint to couple modelnodes
@linkconstraint(graph,n1[:x] == n2[:x])

#Optimize with Ipopt
ipopt = Ipopt.Optimizer
optimize!(graph,ipopt)

#Print solution values
println("n1[:x]= ",value(n1,n1[:x]))
println("n2[:x]= ",value(n2,n2[:x]))
```
