# Plasmo.jl

[Plasmo.jl](https://github.com/plasmo-dev/Plasmo.jl) (Platform for Scalable Modeling and Optimization) is a graph-based algebraic modeling framework that adopts a modular style to
create mathematical optimization problems and manage distributed and hierarchical structures. The package has been developed as a [JuMP](https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl) extension and consequently supports 
most JuMP syntax and functions. 

## Overview

The core data structure in Plasmo.jl is the `OptiGraph`. The optigraph contains a set of optinodes which represent self-contained optimization problems and optiedges that represent coupling between optinodes (which produces an underlying [hypergraph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergraph) structure of optinodes and optiedges). Optigraphs can further be embedded within other optigraphs to create nested hierarchical graph structures. The graph structures obtained using Plasmo.jl can be used for simple model and data management, but they can also be used to perform graph partitioning or develop interfaces to structured optimization solvers.

## Installation

Install Plasmo using `Pkg.add`:
```julia
import Pkg
Pkg.add("Plasmo")
```

## Documentation

The latest documentation is available through [GitHub Pages](https://plasmo-dev.github.io/Plasmo.jl/dev/).
Additional examples can be found in the [examples](https://github.com/plasmo-dev/Plasmo.jl/tree/main/examples) folder.

## Simple Example

```julia
using Plasmo
using Ipopt

#create an optigraph
graph = OptiGraph()

#add nodes to an optigraph
@optinode(graph, n1)
@optinode(graph, n2)

#add variables, constraints, and objective functions to nodes
@variable(n1, 0 <= x <= 2)
@variable(n1, 0 <= y <= 3)
@constraint(n1, x+y <= 4)
@objective(n1, Min, x)

@variable(n2,x)
@NLconstraint(n2, exp(x) >= 2)

#add a linkconstraint to couple nodes
@linkconstraint(graph, n1[:x] == n2[:x])

#optimize with Ipopt
set_optimizer(graph, Ipopt.Optimizer)
optimize!(graph)

#Print solution values
println("n1[:x] = ", value(n1[:x]))
println("n2[:x] = ", value(n2[:x]))
```
